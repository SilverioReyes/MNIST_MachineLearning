# MNIST_MachineLearning
MNIST is a simple computer vision dataset. It consists of images of handwritten digits in which this program, 
a model is trained to look at the images and predict what digits they are by using the Softmax Regression (multinomial logistic regression). An accuracy percentage will be displayed.

This will be the first series of learning machine learning and neural nets.
