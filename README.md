# MNIST_MachineLearning
MNIST is a simple computer vision dataset. It consists of images of handwritten digits that are pulled from a database as an import so that the program can train a model to look at the images and predict what digits they are by using the Softmax Regression (multinomial logistic regression) function. An output of the percentage accuracy will be displayed which is in the low 90s. This accuracy can be improved.

This will be the first series of machine learning and neural nets in order to build my base knowledge for artifical intelligence.
